> Kerri is undoubtedly a good leader to her team, but I observed her being a good leader to everybody who could help improve her team's products. Her dedication to quality and her support to anybody willing to chip in made her a personal resource of mine as I spent my downtime developing my fledgling software development skills. One episode is particularly memorable: I was assigned a job role which the ticketing system didn't quite support. The same day I mentioned this fact, Kerri appeared at my desk to discuss a feature set which would improve my workflow. I wasn't at Blue Box long enough to see its inception, unfortunately, but Kerri's proactive dedication to the users of her team's product definitely stood out to me. Kerri has remained a resource to me since my departure from Blue Box. In that light I have noted her dedication to her craft and her general cool-person-ness.
