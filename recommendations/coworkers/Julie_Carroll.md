> I was fortunate to work with Kerri for nearly three years in a young start up environment. It takes a very special/borderline crack personality type to thrive in such a workplace, and Kerri nailed it. Her dedication to building our web platforms from scratch is something I deeply admire, and she did it all with great integrity and creative oomph.
