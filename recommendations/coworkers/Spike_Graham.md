>Kerri is one of the nicest people that I have worked with in the tech industry. Her calmness and levelheadedness is unflappable and this enables her to be a very effective developer, even in some of the most stressful and unrelenting situations. Kerri writes solid code and has a solid personality to back it up, an award winning combination.
